Download e2etrace
  
  e2etrace is available as binary and as source-code distribution. The latter does not include
  the e2etrace jar-file, so you need to build e2etrace at least once before you can use it (details
  about how to build e2etrace can be found {{{building.html}here}}). The binary distribution contains
  the jar-file, the API documentation and the source code (without unit tests). However, no build
  scripts and unit tests are included.
