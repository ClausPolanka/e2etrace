e2etrace - End-To-End Tracing
Release 1.4.2
http://www.e2etrace.org

                              

RELEASE NOTES
=============

1.4.2
-----

Release 1.4.2 fixes the following problems:

* Added explicit version numbers for the checkstyle and project-info-plugins in pom.xml
  The build was broke because of new plugin versions.


1.4.1
-----

Release 1.4.1 has been updated to match the 3rd edition of my book on Subversion, Maven 
and Redmine (see http://www.km-buch.de). 

Additionally, the following bugs have been fixed:

* CSVTraceFormatter required JDK 1.5 because writer.append() is used. The code has been changed to writer.write(), which
  does the same job and is compatible with older JDKs.
* TraceStep doesn't throw an IllegalStateException any more when calls to enter() and leave() do not match (e.g. when leave() is called
  without calling enter()). Such situations are now handled gracefully and a warning message is printed to the log.
* A number of NPEs related to NoopTraceSession have been fixed:
   - A NoopTraceSession can now directly be assigned to a TraceSessionManager.
   - NoopTraceSession.getConfig() does not return null anymore. Instead, a dummy config instance is returned.
